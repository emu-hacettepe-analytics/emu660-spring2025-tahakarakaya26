Hello there! If you're reading this, I assume you already know what Erasmus is and are familiar with the process you have gone through or will be going through???so I wont be diving into that.

Instead, I want to take a more specific and practical approach by sharing insights about the university I attended, the dorm I stayed in, and the trips I took. Before my own Erasmus experience, I found reading structured, bullet-pointed experiences more useful, so my writing will follow the same format.

**EDUCATION**
I did my Erasmus during the Spring semester of 2021-2022 at Lodz University, located in Lodz, Poland. Even though COVID-19 had lost much of its impact by then, the university decided to continue with online classes. I took a total of five courses and matched all of them as elective courses at my home university, Hacettepe University. I passed four of them (as for the one I did not lets just say the professors incompetence played a big role. He did not even show up to classes).

In general, the courses were very relaxed, nothing like the intense academic pressure we are used to in Turkey. There is only one exam, and to be honest, you would have to actively try to fail. All the courses were in English, so from an educational and course-matching perspective, Poland gets a solid score from me: **9/10.**

**GENERAL LIFE**
Lodz used to be an industrial city back in the day, and while it has developed in that regard, it still has its limit. As someone born and raised in Ankara, I found it a bit underwhelming. There was not much to do, and the university itself had a scattered campus structure, meaning that different faculties were located all over the city. This was a big downside for me because one of the main reasons I chose Hacettepe University was its centralized campus. Due to this, finding extracurricular activities like sports clubs or hobby groups was quite difficult. Without Erasmus groups organizing social events, competitions, and evening activities, life would have been very monotonous.

When it comes to the people, I must say that locals around our age were very friendly and warm-hearted. I received so much help from them, and they were truly wonderful people. However, for those 30 and above, I encountered the same issues I have seen across Europe: language barriers and a certain level of social distance toward foreigners. While I would not call it discrimination, they certainly were not as welcoming as the younger generation. I believe this is more of a cultural difference than anything else. After spending five months living in, eating in, and breathing in this city, I do not want to be unfairly critical, but the overall atmosphere, both in terms of weather and people, was quite cold. It just is what it is. **7/10.**

**TRAVEL**
Now, let???s move on to the most exciting part! I love saying this out loud:
Despite the economic downturn, despite the global inflation crisis, I managed to visit 12 countries and 25 cities! And in 10 countries and 18 cities, I truly immersed myself in the culture.

Everyone has a primary goal when they go on Erasmus. Mine was travel. This was my first time traveling around Europe, and I checked off nearly every place I had ever dreamed of visiting. In fact, I loved some of them so much that I went back two or three times!

And it was incredible.
Swimming in the sea in Barcelona.
Joining a historic Pride march in Bologna, the "Red City"
Experiencing techno clubs in Berlin???
Trying every legal indulgence Amsterdam had to offer.
Sipping espresso in every hidden corner of Rome (I have not touched instant coffee since that trip!)

It was truly, beyond words, amazing.

But of course, no experience is perfect. Despite my efforts to blend in, I often faced language barriers and not due to a lack of effort on my part! I can get by with basic Spanish, and I am very confident in my English, but if you do not speak the local language, you might be treated as an outsider, almost like an intruder. And lets be honest many of us in Turkey have probably seen this behavior from the opposite perspective as well. It is uncomfortable. And to face this while studying abroad, after earning your spot through hard work and dedication, is even more frustrating. Consider this a small warning do not be surprised if you run into this.

Looking at the bigger picture, from sleeping under the Eiffel Tower to crashing in train stations, airports, and bus terminals, travel was a constant adventure, with every moment teaching me something new. My final rating is **10/10.**
If I had the chance, I would do it all over again.

Life is short, do not put off the places you want to see and the lives you want to experience. Be a bird, spread your wings, and fly.

**SUMMARY**
Poland is a beautiful country. And living in Europe is an eye-opening experience. But deep down, I wish my own country could offer the same level of freedom, economy, and opportunities. I wish we could truly live, thrive, and say "Yes, I have a great life here."

Lets keep pushing forward, in the spirit of our nations founding principles, and truly invest in ourselves. Because if we do not do it, no one else will.

For those who did not get accepted into Erasmus, do not be discouraged, there are other exchange programs out there, so keep trying.
And for those who did get in congratulations! I wish you an unforgettable Erasmus experience, from the bottom of my heart.
